    "## What is Random Sequence Enclosure?  \n",
    "**Random sequence enclosure** is a defensive technique that encloses the **user input** between two **random sequences of characters**. This method helps prevent prompt hacking by making it harder for malicious instructions to bypass the intended prompt structure.  \n",

    "## Why Use Random Sequence Enclosure?  \n",
    "Prompt injections often attempt to confuse the model by introducing hidden instructions. By enclosing user input within random sequences:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- It becomes difficult for attackers to manipulate the model's behavior.  \n",
    "- The model can better distinguish valid input from malicious commands.  \n",
    "- Longer sequences provide stronger protection, increasing security.  \n",

    "## Best Practices for Random Sequence Enclosure  \n",
    "1. **Use Longer Sequences:** A sequence length of **12 or more characters** offers better protection.  \n",
    "2. **Randomize Characters:** Mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits for stronger randomness.  \n",
    "3. **Combine with Other Defenses:** Using this method alongside **instruction defense** or **post-prompting** maximizes security.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## üîç **Note**  \n",
    "Longer sequences are generally **more effective** at preventing malicious manipulations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "**Random sequence enclosure** is an effective defense mechanism that helps distinguish between user input and developer instructions. By enclosing input within random sequences, this method reduces the risk of instruction overrides, enhancing the overall security of your AI system."
